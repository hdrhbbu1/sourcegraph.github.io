## Master Plan 
We believe code intelligence can help bring the future sooner. Our long-term vision is to make it so everyone, in every community, in every country, and in every industry can create products using the best technology. Here is what we are working on now to help this happen:

* Make basic code intelligence ubiquitous
* Make code review continuous and intelligent
* Increase the amount and quality of open-source code
