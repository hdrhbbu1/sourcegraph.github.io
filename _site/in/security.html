Every component of Sourcegraph was designed with security in mind. We've detailed our strict production security guidelines for customers below.</h1>

<p>We don't stop at keeping your code safe. When your team's developers use Sourcegraph, they can discover and use your own security best practices much more easily in your own code. Your team can also more easily enforce security standards during code review.</p>

<p>If you have specific questions or concerns, contact us at <a href="mailto:security@sourcegraph.com">security@sourcegraph.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="access-controls">Access controls</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Access to all internal systems is protected by multi-factor authentication. Access is restricted to those who require it to perform their job, and is regularly reviewed and revoked upon termination or when no longer needed.</li>

  <li>Device management is in place for remote wiping of all devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="network-security">Network security</h2>

  <li>All production systems are hosted on Google Cloud Platform (https://cloud.google.com/security/), where all storage volumes are encrypted at rest.</li>
  <li>All external network communication between production services occur over HTTPS / TLS.</li>
  <li>Authentication is handled using Auth0 (https://auth0.com/security), so Sourcegraph never stores your login credentials.</li>
  <li>External access to production systems is restricted by firewall to restricted IP ranges.</li>
  <li>Our dedicated security team at Sourcegraph handles all security escalations, and is available 24/7.</li>
  <li>Customer data can be deleted from all primary and backup systems within 7 days of request.</li>
